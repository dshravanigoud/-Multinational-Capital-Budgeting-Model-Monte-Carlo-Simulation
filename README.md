🌎 Multinational Capital Budgeting Model

Monte Carlo Simulation | FX Risk | NPV Analysis

📌 Overview

This project evaluates a U.S. company’s expansion into Mexico using a fully dynamic capital budgeting model.

The model analyzes Net Present Value (NPV) from both:
	•	Project (MXN) perspective
	•	Parent (USD) perspective

It integrates operational uncertainty, exchange rate risk, inflation, interest rates, and managerial decision rules using Monte Carlo simulation.


🎯 Objective

To determine whether the firm should accept or reject the foreign investment by:
	•	Forecasting 10 years of cash flows (2025–2034)
	•	Modeling exchange rate uncertainty
	•	Simulating risk distributions
	•	Comparing NPV outcomes under different FX forecasting frameworks


🛠 Model Components

1️⃣ Pro-Forma Financial Model
	•	Revenue forecasts across 5 product lines
	•	Inflation-adjusted pricing
	•	Variable cost distributions
	•	Operating expenses & salary inflation
	•	Depreciation schedules (facility, molds, equipment)
	•	After-tax operating cash flows
	•	Terminal value & early termination logic


2️⃣ Exchange Rate Modeling

Implemented three FX forecasting approaches:
	•	Random Walk Model
	•	Interest Rate Parity (IRP)
	•	Relative Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

Each method dynamically forecasts MXN/USD rates and converts project cash flows into USD for parent-level valuation.


3️⃣ Monte Carlo Simulation

To capture uncertainty across multiple variables:
	•	Assigned probability distributions to:
	•	Sales volumes
	•	Variable costs
	•	Interest rates
	•	Inflation rates
	•	Capital expenditures
	•	Modeled correlations between inflation and interest rates
	•	Simulated thousands of scenarios
	•	Generated NPV distributions
	•	Measured probability of positive NPV
	•	Conducted sensitivity analysis


4️⃣ Real Options & Termination Rules

Embedded managerial flexibility:
	•	Project evaluation checkpoints (2027 & 2030)
	•	Conditional early sale based on cash flow thresholds
	•	Terminal value multiple if held to 2034

Analyzed how termination rules affect downside risk and project value.
